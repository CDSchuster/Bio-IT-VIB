# Bio-IT-VIB
Code, results and report for the Bio-IT task I was assigned for my second interview for the postdoc position at the De Preter lab in VIB-Ghent.

In addition to the data files provided by the lab, as well as the *yaml* file for the conda environment, the repo contains the report **Bio-IT task report.docx**, the output files `bulk_samples_deconv_output.csv` and `bulk_samples_deconv_plot.png` and two bash script files containing the commands used to install the conda environment (`install_conda_env.sh`) and to run *meth-atlas* (`run_meth_analysis.sh`).

In order to get a deeper insight into the data, some correlation analyses were performed. Those can be found in the Notebook `Data_exploration.ipynb`
